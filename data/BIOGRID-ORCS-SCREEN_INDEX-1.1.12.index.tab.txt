To identify gene hits at an FDR < 0.05, ORCS estimated FDRs for the CERES GeCKOv2 dataset using customized gold-standard positive and negative sets of genes. The custom positive set included genes essential in at least 90% of cell lines in both the CERES Avana dataset (PMID:29083409) and the 10 cell lines included in Bertomeu et al. (PMID:29038160). The custom negative set included genes essential in zero cell lines from one of the two datasets and in <=10% of the other dataset. Genes scoring among the top 1,500 in >10% and at least two cell lines in either of the following three studies were further filtered from the negative set: PMID:27260156, PMID:27760321, PMID:28162770.
